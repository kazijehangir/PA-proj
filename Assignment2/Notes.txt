for each basic block compute the number of instructions, 
and keep track of that. then at the end of the basic block 
add a call to a function that takes into account those 
instruction counts. so that when the program is run, 
each basic block has a function call at the end to take 
it's instruction counts to the total. and if the basic block
is executed, the function call is too. will need to 
figure out what happens to loops though.
